 <b>WEB TECHNOLOGY</b>  You probably know that computers don't communicate with each other the way that people do. Instead, computers require codes, or directions. These binary codes and commands allow computers to process needed information. Every second, billions upon billions of ones and zeros are processed in order to provide you with the information you need.
So what does that have to do with your ability to post your latest pictures online? Everything.
The methods by which computers communicate with each other through the use of markup languages and multimedia packages is known as web technology. In the past few decades, web technology has undergone a dramatic transition, from a few marked up web pages to the ability to do very specific work on a network without interruption. Let's look at some examples of web technology.

 Learning Web Technology is essential today because Internet has become the number one source to information, and many of the traditional software applications have become Web Applications. Web Applications have become more powerfull and can fully replace desktop application in most situations.
Thats why you need to know basic Web Programming, including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. To create more powerful Web Sites and Web Applications you also need to know about Web Servers, Database Systems and Web Frameworks like PHP, ASP.NET, etc.

It all started with Internet (1960s) and the World Wide Web - WWW (1991). The first Web Browser, Netscape, came in 1994. This was the beggining of a new era, where everything is connected on internet, the socalled Internet of Things (IoT).
