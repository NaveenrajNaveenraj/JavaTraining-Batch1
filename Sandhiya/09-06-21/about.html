  About Skydiving 
  </font>  
  </h1>
  <p align="justify">Skydiving is parachuting from an airplane for fun. </br><br>
  Skydiving can be done individually and with groups of people. </br><br>
  
  Training is required. Unlike most paratroopers, skydivers often wait until they are low, before opening the parachute.</br><br>
  The jump can also be made from a helicopter or a balloon that is high enough in the sky. Skydiving can be an exciting sport.</br><br>

Skydiving includes free falling (usually from an aeroplane) through the air prior to opening a parachute.</br><br>
 Typically skydives are carried out from around 4,000m (or 12,500ft) offering 40 to 50 seconds of freefall time.</br><br>
 Longer free fall times can be achieved by exiting an aircraft at altitudes much higher than 4,000m, </br><br>
 but very high jumps require pressurized oxygen within the aircraft, and bottled oxygen for the diver.</br><br>
 During a skydive, total freedom and control of the air can be enjoyed as well as many complex and spectacular manoeuvres including flat turns,</br><br>
 somersaults and formation skydiving.</br><br>
 Skydiving can be enjoyed either as an individual - doing solo(alone) jumps - or as part of a team carrying out formation skydiving. </br><br>
 Generally, the term ‘skydive’ refers to the time spent in freefall from exiting an aircraft to deploying a parachute </br><br>
 but skydiving does include some disciplines such as accuracy landings and canopy formation flying which concentrate </br><br>
 on the time spent once a canopy has been deployed.</br></p>
