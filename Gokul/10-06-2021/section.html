<h1>Fashion as an Art Form</h1>
<p> 
      Art, to me, is a way that one expresses his views, his ideas, and his personality. Art can be displayed through paintings, poetry,
  music, etc. One form of art is fashion. The way one dresses can represent different aspects of his personality. 
  People often try to express themselves through the clothing and accessories that they wear.
   Designers are artists who piece together garments using fabric and creativity; your body is a canvass to express yourself 
   using different colors and styles of clothing.

  New York is one of the largest fashion capitols in the world. Fashion Week,
   held in Bryant Park, is a popular world-renown event in which famous designers are able
    to display their newest creations on the runway.
     Both designers and viewers alike only dream of being invited to Fashion Week.
      I actually almost went to Fashion Week this year, but unfortunately was unable to attend. I
       was considerably disappointed when I discovered I would miss out on this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see the latest designs and styles on the catwalk.

  There are so many different styles and trends that are seen on the streets of New York City. Everyone in New York is so different and has different ideas they want to project through their personal styles. I have been in New York for a little over 3 weeks and have seen styles such as bohemian, punk, urban, earthy, edgy, modern, ghetto, and so many more. Often I’ll find mixtures of different styles that create new looks I have never seen before. Each style that I see is unique to the person who wears it and can give you insight to parts of their personality.

  Next time you walk down the streets of New York, take a look around. The people who surround you may be trying to tell you a story with their clothing. The styles that they choose can show some of their ideas, what they believe in, and who they are. 
<br> I think fashion is an art form - you might call it decorative or applied art as opposed to fine art, but what's the distinction? Because the same amount of artistic expression goes into clothes, a piece of pottery or a painting. I've founded a museum on the basis that I think it's an artistic form that should be remembered. I think fashion galleries - such as the one at the V&A and the one at the Metropolitan in New York - are very relevant.

Fashion can tell you what people wore at a certain period just as pottery can tell you what their tea parties were like. I don't think the fact that these things were designed to be practical distinguishes them from fine art. You could say a painting is designed to go on the wall, but if it were made as a fresco, where it was part of the wall, would you say it was not art because it was practical?

Fine art at the moment is no longer particularly concerned with beauty, so you could say that fashion - which is always about a concept of beauty, whether or not everyone agrees on the concept - is more relevant, more artistic, than the garbage they put out as conceptual. If you look at it that way, fine art may go by the wayside, and fashion, which has a bit more effort put into it, will take over.

Some designers are directly influenced by fine art - a lot of Bill Gibb's things were influenced by the slashed panels in dresses in, say, Flemish paintings. I myself once designed something called the Venus dress which was somewhat influenced by Botticelli, though I haven't really gone too much in that direction. But when I see my clothes in my museum I don't feel any differently from how I felt about them at the time - I see that I believed in what I did with them, that they were the right thing to do.

Ossie Clark would have argued that fashion was art - he definitely thought his contribution was worthwhile, and his clothes were being shown in museums even at the time. He certainly would have expected them to be in museums now.

On a trip to Paris, the New York fashion designer Donna Karan was dragged off to the Picasso Museum by her late husband, Stephen Weiss. He hoped that his wife would love it as much as he did. Instead, or so he told American Vogue, she dashed at speed from gallery to gallery barely pausing to look at the works.

Suddenly Weiss heard Donna screaming with glee in another gallery. At last, he thought, she has finally found a Picasso that inspires her. He ran into the gallery only to discover his wife gazing at a bare expanse of green wall. This particular shade of green, she explained breathlessly, would be perfect for next season's lingerie.

Now, this story tells us a great deal about Donna Karan, not least that she is refreshingly free from pretentiousness and pomposity when it comes to her chosen field. You can't help wondering whether, if you asked Donna 'Is fashion art?', her response would be the style slut's equivalent of former Liverpool manager Bill Shankley's proclamation: 'Some say football is a matter of life and death - I'd say it's much more important than that.'

Quibbling over whether fashion is more or less important than art is just as pointless as questioning whether or not it is art. Of course it's not, it's fashion. That is not to say that fashion, at its best, is not a suitable subject for museums or that it cannot share some of the attributes of art. On the contrary, an exquisite haute couture dress - like the ones that Cristóbal Balenciaga created in his 1950s heyday - can look as perfect as a beautiful painting or sculpture.

Yet only an old-fashioned aesthete would argue that the role of the artist is to create beauty. Sometimes artists do, but for most of them beauty tends to be a by-product of their quest to explore the complex, messy, ambiguities of modern life. Think of Wolfgang Tillmans's photographs of areroplane wings and window sills now on display at Tate Britain. Beautifully composed they may be, but with a forlorn beauty too subtle to be replicated in fashion.

Similarly, fashion is adept at fulfilling another traditional function of art by reflecting changes in contemporary culture, but only up to a point. Think of how the Ossie Clark dresses in the V&A's exhibition evoke the desire for escapism at the turn of the 1970s. Yet, unlike art, fashion rarely expresses more than the headlines of history.

And fashion has a practical purpose, whereas art does not. The result may be as gorgeous as a vintage Balenciaga ballgown or an eloquent political metaphor for its time, but it is still an item of clothing intended to be worn. Why pretend that it is anything else?
